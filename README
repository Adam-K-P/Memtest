Memory corruption test
______________________

mem_test tests for memory corruption with the established method used by 
mm/memtest.c.

Namely, it writes a pattern to an address then reads back the data at that
address.  If the data at the address matches the data originally written
to the address, then the memory is fine -- if the data differs from the 
tested pattern though, the memory is corrupted.
